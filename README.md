Care is an Android app developed to DePaul University CSC 595 in partnership with Allstate Insurance Company. In this repository you are going to find all the source code used to build Care's prototype.


What is Care about?
-------------
Care is a driverâ€™s network that focus on helping young drivers to improve their driving behavior and spread the idea by interacting with their friends and other users through the app. 

Care's Goal
-------------
Care's goal is to create good habits on teenagers drivers. The app uses a reward program and attractive gamification concepts to engage teenagers and help them to learn how to drive better. Care uses phone sensors and Allstate Driving Engine API to track driver's speeding, hard breaking and dangerous curves. 

The app produces challenges to stimulate good driving behavior, and the user earns points for being a good driver. Care also allows users to challenge their friends, and rate other drivers based on the data collected during their trips. The user can also schedule maintenance alerts and answer quizzes related with driving safety.
